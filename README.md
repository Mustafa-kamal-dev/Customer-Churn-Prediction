# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data to understand patterns that lead to customer churn (customers leaving the service). The goal is to build machine learning models that can predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## 📌 Objective

* Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Identify key factors that contribute to customer churn.
* Train machine learning models to predict churn.
* Compare model performance.

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains telecom customers' demographic information, service usage, and billing details.

**Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
* Encoded categorical columns

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Visualized churn distribution
* Checked correlations
* Customer behavior patterns

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Label encoding
* One-hot encoding for categorical features
* Scaling numerical features

### 4. Model Building

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier

### 5. Model Evaluation

* Accuracy Score
* Classification Report
* Confusion Matrix

## 🏁 Conclusion

* Extracted important factors that drive customer churn
* Compared different ML models to find best performing
